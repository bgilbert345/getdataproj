Subjects were numbered 1 through 30 and performed six different activities: WALKING, WALKING UPSTAIRS, WALKING DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, and LAYING.
Each row corresponds to a single subject performing a single activity, as identified by the first two columns of the table.
The other 66 columns represent the average of, respectively, the mean and standard deviation of various measures of the subject's motion throughout the collection of data.
Mean values are labeled with the tag "mean()" and standard deviation values are labeled with the tag "std()".
Time frequency domain signals begin with "t", and frequency domain signals begin with "f".
Measurements of motion in the X, Y, and Z axes are labeled respectively with (capital) X, Y, and Z.
The label "Mag" indicates a Euclidean norm, the square root of the sum of squares over each axis.
Body acceleration is labeled BodyAcc and gravity acceleration is labeled GravityAcc. Measured in g, the magnitude of acceleration due to gravity, normalized between -1 and 1
The acceleration measurements were derived in time to obtain jerk signals; these are labeled with "Jerk". Measured in g/second, normalized between -1 and 1.
"Gyro" labels a measurement of angular, rather than linear, acceleration. Measured in radians/second, normalized between -1 and 1.

EXAMPLE: "fBodyAcc-mean()-X" - in the frequency domain, the mean of the body acceleration in the X direction
